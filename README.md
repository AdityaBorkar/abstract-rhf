NOTE - This library is made as a side project, ideated from own requirements. I am eager to hear your feedback and feature requests. Kindly drop your suggestions in this form OR discord server.

## Features:

- Fully type-safe
- Async validation
- Bring your own schema
- Bring your own persistence
- Opinionated Library (I consider this as a pro)

## Cons:

- Server Side Rendering is not supported.
- Not Framework Agnostic. Supports React only.
- Experimental Library. Not for production use. We plan for a production-ready launch in April 2025. Your feedback is deeply appreciated.

## Examples:

- PATTERN 1: Make all definations in zod schema
- PATTERN 2: Make a custom useForm() hook that is reusable
- PATTERN 3: Add some animations AND transitions using framer-motion

## Planned Features:

We are thinking on the following features:

- Components Library that auto-selects the component based on the field type.
- Internationalization and localization
