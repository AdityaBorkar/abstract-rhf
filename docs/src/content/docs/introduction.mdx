# Introduction

We are making forms simpler with an abstract layer over react-hook-form. We are focused on providing a better developer experience and full type safety.

We have omitted certain API options and renamed them to make it more intuitive. We are opinionated and believe that the best API is the one that is most intuitive and easiest to use.

## Key Features

- ðŸŽ¯ Type-safe form handling
- ðŸŽ¨ Simple and intuitive API
